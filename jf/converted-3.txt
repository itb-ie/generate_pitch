Short-Selling Risk
JOSEPH E. ENGELBERG, ADAM V. REED, and MATTHEW C. RINGGENBERG*

ABSTRACT

Short sellers face unique risks, such as the risk that stock loans become expensive
and the risk that stock loans are recalled. We show that short-selling risk affects
prices among the cross-section of stocks. Stocks with more short-selling risk have
lower returns, less price efficiency, and less short selling.

“Some stocks are hard to borrow. Herbalife is not, especially, but it is risky
to borrow... If Carl Icahn were to launch a tender offer, say, it might get
a lot more expensive to short Herbalife, and the convertible trade would
become considerably less fun.”

—Matt Levine, Former Investment Banker, BloombergView (2014)!

SHORT SELLING IS A RISKY BUSINESS. SHORT SELLERS must identify mispriced
securities, borrow shares in the equity lending market, postcollateral, and pay a
loan fee each day until the position closes. In addition to the standard risks that
many traders face, such as margin calls and regulatory changes, short sellers
also face the risk of loan recalls and the risk of changing loan fees. To date, the
literature has viewed these risks as a static cost to short sellers, and empirical

papers have shown that static impediments to short selling significantly affect
asset prices and efficiency.” The idea in the literature is simple: if short selling
is costly, short sellers may be less likely to trade, and as a result prices may
be biased or less efficient (e.g., Miller (1977), Diamond and Verrecchia (1987),
Lamont and Thaler (2003)).

In this paper, we examine the costs of short selling from a different per-
spective. Specifically, we show that the dynamic risks associated with short
selling result in significant limits to arbitrage. In particular, stocks with more
short-selling risk have lower future returns, less price efficiency, and less short
selling.

Consider two stocks—A and B—that are identical in every way except for
their short-selling risk. Specifically, stock A and stock B have identical funda-
mentals as well as identical loan fees and number of shares available today,
but future loan fees and share availability are more uncertain for stock B than
for stock A; that is, there is considerable risk that future loan fees for stock B
will be higher and future shares of stock B will be unavailable for borrowing.
Since higher loan fees reduce the profits from short selling and limited share
availability can force short sellers to close their position before the arbitrage
is complete, a short seller would prefer to short stock A because it has lower
short-selling risk. In this paper, we present the first evidence that uncertainty
regarding future short sale constraints is a significant risk, and we show that
this risk affects trading and asset prices.

The short-selling risk we describe has theoretical underpinnings in several
existing models. For example, in D’Avolio (2002b) and Duffie, Garleanu, and
Pedersen (2002), short-selling fees and share availability are a function of
the differences of opinion between optimists and pessimists, and short-selling
risk emerges as these differences evolve. As noted by D’Avolio (2002a, p. 279),
“_..a short seller is concerned not only with the level of fees, but also with
fee variance.” Accordingly, we focus on the variance of lending fees as our
natural proxy for short-selling risk. To get the best possible measure of this
proxy, we project the variance of lending fees on several equity lending market
characteristics and firm characteristics. We then use fitted values from this
forecasting model (ShortRisk) as our measure of short-selling risk.°

Using this measure, we examine whether short-selling risk affects arbitrage
activity. If short-selling risk limits the ability of arbitrageurs to trade and

2 To test the impact of impediments to short selling, existing studies examine a wide variety of
potential measures of short sale constraints including regulatory action (Jones (2008), Diether, Lee,
and Werner (2009), Battalio and Schultz (2011), Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2013)), institutional
ownership (Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter (2005), Nagel (2005)), the availability of traded options
(Figlewski and Webb (1993), Danielsen and Sorescu (2001)), and current loan fees (Jones and
Lamont (2002), Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2009)). However, all of these are static measures of
short sale constraints (i.e., they examine how conditions today constrain short sellers), while we
focus on the dynamics of short selling constraints (i.e., we examine how the risk of changing future
constraints impacts short sellers).

3 Our results are robust to using alternate measures of short-selling risk, including the uncon-
ditional historical variance of loan fees for each stock. These results are shown in the Internet
Appendix, which is available in the online version of this article.

correct mispricing, then it should be related to returns, market efficiency, and
short-selling activity. We find that it is. First, we show that our short-selling
risk proxy is related to future returns: a long-short portfolio formed based
on ShortRisk earns a 9.6% annual five-factor alpha. Next, in a Fama and
MacBeth (1973) regression framework we confirm the return predictability of
short-selling risk after controlling for a variety of firm characteristics. We also
consider the Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) mispricing measure (MISP) and
find that MISP’s ability to predict returns is greatest among stocks with high
short-selling risk. Thus, higher short-selling risk appears to limit the ability
of arbitrageurs to correct mispricing, and as a result these stocks earn lower
future returns.*

We next test whether increases in short-selling risk are associated with de-
creases in price efficiency. We examine the Hou and Moskowitz (2005) measure
of price delay and find that short-selling risk is associated with significantly
larger price delay, even after controlling for current loan market conditions
(Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011)); a one-standard-deviation increase in ShortRisk
is associated with a 6.8% increase in price delay. Thus, the risk of future short-
selling constraints is associated with decreased price efficiency today, inde-
pendent of short constraints that may exist at the time a short position is
initiated.

Of course, if short-selling risk is truly a limit to arbitrage, then we would
expect this risk to affect trading activity, especially for trades with a long
expected time to completion.® Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004, p. 329)
note that the “... difficulty of shorting may increase with the horizon length,
as investors must pay the rebate rate spread over longer periods and short
positions are more likely to be recalled.” To test this prediction, we turn to one
of the only cases in which mispricing and the expected holding horizon of a
trade can be objectively measured ex ante. Specifically, we examine deviations
between stock prices and the synthetic stock price implied from put-call parity.
Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004) and Evans et al. (2009) show that
deviations between the actual and synthetic stock price often imply that a
short seller would short sell the underlying stock and purchase the synthetic
stock, with the expectation that the two prices will converge upon the option
expiration date. Accordingly, we measure mispricing using the natural log of
the ratio of the actual stock price to the implied stock price (henceforth put-
call disparity) as in Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004), and we examine
whether short sellers trade less on mispricings when short-selling risk is high
and when the option has a long time to maturity. We find that they do. In
particular, arbitrageurs short significantly less when short-selling risk is high,
and as a result there is more mispricing today. Moreover, both of these effects
are significantly larger for long-horizon trades.

4 This result is consistent with models of limits to arbitrage. For example, the model in Shleifer
and Vishny (1997) predicts that stocks that are riskier to arbitrage will exhibit greater mispricing
and have higher average returns to arbitrage.

5 We thank an anonymous referee and the Editor for suggesting this point.

When ShortRisk and days to expiration are at the 25** percentile in our
sample, short volume is approximately 5.1% below its unconditional mean and
put-call disparity today is approximately 13.9% above its unconditional mean.
However, when ShortRisk and days to expiration are at the 75" percentile
in our sample, short volume is 21.7% below its unconditional mean and put-
call disparity today is approximately 149% above its unconditional mean.® In
other words, higher short-selling risk leads to significantly less short selling by
arbitrageurs and greater mispricing today, and longer holding horizons magnify
both of these effects.

Of course, it is natural to expect that the risks we describe here could be
correlated with other well-known predictors of returns. For example, Ang et al.
(2006) show that high idiosyncratic volatility is associated with low future
returns. We find that all of our results continue to hold after controlling for other
known predictors of returns, including liquidity and idiosyncratic volatility
(e.g., Ang et al. (2006), Pontiff (2006)).

Overall, our results make several contributions. First, and most importantly,
this is the first paper to show that uncertainty regarding future short-selling
constraints acts as a significant limit to arbitrage. Specifically, we show that
higher short-selling risk is associated with lower future returns, decreased
price efficiency, and less short-selling activity by arbitrageurs. We also show
that these effects are more pronounced for trades with a long expected hold-
ing horizon. In addition, we show that short-selling risk is particularly high
when there are extreme returns, indicating that short-selling risk may have an
adverse correlation with returns. Finally, we note that our findings may help
explain existing anomalies, including the low short-interest puzzle (Lamont
and Stein (2004)). Short-selling risk may also help explain the puzzling fact
that short interest data predict future returns even though short interest is
publicly observable. In other words, the fact that short interest data predict
returns and are publicly released by the exchanges begs the question: why
dont other investors arbitrage away the predictive ability of short interest? Our
results provide a partial explanation: short selling is risky.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section I briefly describes
the existing literature, Section II describes the data used in this study, Section
III characterizes our findings, and Section IV concludes.

I. Background

Although we consider short sale constraints from a dynamic perspective, a
large literature has considered these constraints from a static perspective. In
this section, we briefly discuss existing work concerning short sale constraints
and limits to arbitrage. We then formalize the hypotheses introduced in the
beginning of the paper.

6 The 25* and 75 percentiles of ShortRisk are 1.54 and 5.38, respectively. The 25'* and 75th
percentiles of months to expiration are two and five months, respectively.

A. Existing Literature

On the theoretical side, multiple papers have argued that short sale con-
straints can have an economically significant effect on asset prices (e.g., Miller
(1977), Harrison and Kreps (1978), Diamond and Verrecchia (1987)). In addi-
tion, empiricists have investigated multiple forms of short-selling constraints,
including regulatory restrictions and equity loan fees.

Several papers have analyzed the effect of short sale constraints by exam-
ining changes in the regulatory environment. For example, Diether, Lee, and
Werner (2009) examine the effects of the Regulation SHO pilot and find limited
evidence that short-selling activity changed when the uptick rule was lifted.
Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2013) find that the U.S. short-selling ban reduced
market quality and liquidity. More broadly, Beber and Pagano (2013) find that
worldwide short-selling restrictions slowed price discovery.

The equity loan market also provides an opportunity for researchers to study
the impact of short sale constraints. Using loan fees from the equity loan
market, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2002) suggest that short-selling constraints
have a limited impact on well-accepted arbitrage portfolios such as size, book-
to-market, and momentum portfolios. Using institutional ownership as a proxy
for supply in the equity loan market, Hirshleifer, Teoh, and Yu (2011) examine
the relation between short sales and both the accrual and net operating asset
anomalies. They find that short sellers do try to arbitrage mispricings, but
short sale constraints appear to limit their ability to arbitrage them away.

Several papers abstract from specific short sale constraints and instead use
the general fact that short selling is more constrained than buying to examine
possible asymmetries in long-short portfolio returns. Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan
(2012) examine a variety of anomalies and find that they tend to be more pro-
nounced on the short side, consistent with the idea that short selling is riskier,
leading to less short selling by arbitrageurs. In a related paper, Stambaugh,
Yu, and Yuan (2015) note that idiosyncratic volatility is negatively related to
returns among underpriced stocks but is positively related to returns among
overpriced stocks. More recently, Drechsler and Drechsler (2014) document a
shorting premium and show that asset pricing anomalies are largest for stocks
with high equity lending fees.

Finally, in a recent paper, Prado, Saffi, and Sturgess (2016) examine the cross-
sectional relation between institutional ownership, short sale constraints, and
abnormal stock returns. They find that firms with lower levels of institu-
tional ownership and/or more concentrated institutional ownership tend to
have higher equity lending fees, and these firms also tend to earn abnormal
returns that are significantly more negative.

B. Hypothesis Development

In this paper, we empirically examine the risk that future lending conditions
might move against a short seller. In what follows, we use existing theory to
motivate our empirical measures and develop testable predictions.

Several extant papers lend support to the idea that short-selling risk im-
pacts arbitrage activity. Mitchell, Pulvino, and Stafford (2002, p. 578-79) em-
pirically examine arbitrage activity for situations in which the market value of
a company is less than its subsidiary and find that short-selling risk can limit
arbitrage activity. They specifically discuss short-selling risk, noting that “The
possibility of being bought-in at an unattractive price provides a disincentive
for arbitrageurs to take a large position.” Consistent with this view, D’Avolio
(2002b, p. 279) develops a theoretical model of equilibrium in the lending mar-
ket and D’Avolio (2002a) explains that “In a multiperiod setting, a short seller
is concerned not only with the level of fees, but also with fee variance. This is
because current regulations stipulate that lenders maintain the right to cancel
a loan at any time and hence preclude most large institutions from providing
guaranteed term loans.”

In D’Avolio (2002b), a short seller can respond to changes in lending market
conditions by “buying, p. 5 back the shares and returning them to the lender,
or re-establishing the short at the higher loan fee.” Thus, the model shows that
share recalls and loan fee increases both reflect the same underlying event:
changes in lending conditions that leave the loan market temporarily out of
equilibrium. As a result, recalls and fee changes are not independent risks:
a share recall can be seen as an extremely high loan fee. Consistent with
theoretical models, we develop two empirical measures of short-selling risk in
Section II. We view our measures as proxies for the risk of short sale constraints
that arise from changes in lending market conditions.

The model in D’Avolio (2002b) also suggests that lending market conditions
impact arbitrage activity.’ Specifically, the model shows that short selling is
less attractive to arbitrageurs when short-selling risk is high.* While D’Avolio
(2002b) does not explicitly model the short seller’s demand function in the mul-
tiperiod case with short-selling risk, a related model in D’Avolio and Perold
(2008, p. 16) shows that short sellers will be less likely to trade if the proba-
bility of binding future short sale constraints is high. Furthermore, this model
suggests that the expected trading horizon matters. D’Avolio and Perold (2008,
p. 16) show that short sellers’ willingness to trade will be low when “the ex-
pected price correction is unlikely to occur in the near future.”

We use these results to generate several testable predictions regarding the
impact of short-selling risk. First, we hypothesize that high short-selling risk
is associated with less trading by short sellers, consistent with the predictions
in D’Avolio (2002a and 2002b) and D’Avolio and Perold (2003). Second, consis-
tent with models of limits to arbitrage (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny (1997)), we
hypothesize that stocks with higher arbitrage risk, in this case short-selling

7The model in Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) can generate similar predictions. Specifically,
if we introduce a stochastic loan fee to the model, the solution to the utility maximization problem
shows that portfolio weights are decreasing in the variance of loan fees, and as a consequence
mispricing is an increasing function of the variance of loan fees.

8 The model focuses primarily on a one-period case, in which equity lending conditions are known
with certainty. However, the paper includes a multiperiod extension that discusses short-selling
risk.

risk, exhibit greater mispricing. Third, as suggested by Ofek, Richardson, and
Whitelaw (2004) and D’Avolio and Perold (2003), we hypothesize that the im-
pact of short-selling risk is greater for trades with a longer expected holding
horizon. Finally, we note that existing literature finds that short selling leads
to improved price efficiency (Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011)). This leads to our
fourth hypothesis, namely, that stocks with more short-selling risk have less
price efficiency.

In sum, we hypothesize that arbitrageurs may be less willing to short when
future lending conditions are more uncertain and when the expected holding
horizon is longer. As a result, short-selling risk may impact returns, price
efficiency, and trading volume.

II. Data

To test the hypotheses discussed above, we combine daily equity lending data
with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), Compustat,
NYSE Trade and Quote (TAQ) database, and OptionMetrics, as discussed in
detail below.

A. Equity Lending Data

The equity lending data used in our analyses come from Markit. The data are
sourced from a variety of contributing customers including beneficial owners,
hedge funds, investment banks, lending agents, and prime brokers; the market
participants that contribute to this database are believed to account for the
majority of all equity loans in the United States. The initial database includes
information on a variety of overseas markets and share classes. However, we
exclude data on non-U.S. firms, American Depository Receipts (ADRs), and
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and we drop firms that have a stock price
below $5 or a market capitalization below $10 million; we also require each firm
to have at least 50 nonmissing days each year to be included in the sample. The
resulting database includes approximately 220,000 observations at the firm-
month level for 4,500 U.S. equities over the 5.5-year period from July 1, 2006
through December 31, 2011.

The equity lending database includes several variables from the equity loan
market. Of primary interest are shares borrowed (Short Interest), the active
quantity of shares available to be borrowed (Loan Supply), the active utilization
rate (Utilization), the weighted average loan fee across all shares currently on
loan (Loan Fee), the weighted average loan fee for all new loans over the past
day (New Loan Fee), and the weighted average number of days that transac-
tions have been open (Loan Length). A stock’s Loan Supply represents the total
number of shares that institutions are actively willing to lend, expressed as a
percentage of shares outstanding. The Utilization rate is the quantity of shares
loaned out as a percentage of Loan Supply. Finally, Loan Fee, often referred
to as specialness, is the cost of borrowing a share in basis points (bps) per
annum.

Table I
Summary Statistics

Table I displays summary statistics. The sample combines equity lending data from Markit with
data from CRSP, Compustat, NYSE TAQ, and OptionMetrics. The sample contains approximately
4,500 U.S. equities over the period July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2011. Panel A displays the
Mean, Median, 1 Percentile, 99*® Percentile, and Standard Deviation values of selected equity
lending variables. Loan Supply represents the total number of shares owned by institutions with
lending programs, expressed as a percentage of shares outstanding. Short Interest is the total
quantity of shares that were loaned out as a percentage of shares outstanding. Short Volume is
the natural log of short volume as a fraction of shares outstanding from TAQ (multiplied by 100
for scaling). Utilization is the quantity of shares loaned out as a percentage of shares available
to be borrowed. Loan Fee, often referred to as specialness, is the cost of borrowing a share in
bps per annum. Loan Length is the weighted average number of days that loans have been open.
Qty. Failures is the total quantity of shares that were not delivered as scheduled, expressed as a
percentage of shares outstanding. Panel B displays time-series properties of the lending market.
For each firm, we first calculate the time-series summary statistics, and the table presents the
cross-sectional mean of these values. Panel C displays information regarding firm characteristics:
Market Capitalization and Monthly Return are from CRSP. Panel D displays information on our
short-selling risk measure as defined in Section II of the text.

Panel A of Table I contains summary statistics for the equity lending
database. For the typical firm, approximately 18% of shares outstanding are
available to be borrowed and around 4% are actually on loan at any given point
in time. The median loan fee is only 11 bps per annum. It is well known, how-
ever, that loan fees exhibit considerable skewness, as indicated by the mean
of 85 bps and the 99* percentile of 1,479 bps. The median loan is open for
approximately 65 days, indicating that short sellers often hold their position

open for several months and thus are exposed to changes in loan fees. While
the magnitude of loan fees may seem small when compared to other risks faced
by arbitrageurs, especially when looking at the median loan fee of 11 bps, the
99* percentile of loan fees in our sample is 14.79% per year—as discussed
in Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013), loan fees can increase to levels
that significantly decrease the profitability of nearly any trade. In Panel B, we
examine the within-firm (i.e., time-series) properties of lending market condi-
tions. We calculate the mean, median, 1**, and 99" percentiles of loan fees and
utilization by firm, and then display the cross-sectional mean of these sum-
mary statistics. The mean of the 99" percentile of loans fees is 301 bps points,
while the 1** percentile is 7 bps. Thus, the average stock experiences dramatic
variation in its loan fees over time.

In addition to the equity lending data discussed above, we use publicly avail-
able data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Web site to add
information on failures to deliver. Failures to deliver occur when shares are
not delivered by the standard three-day settlement date (often referred to as t
+ 3); the SEC provides the aggregate net balance of shares that failed to be de-
livered on each date. The data provide information on the cumulative number
of shares that have not been delivered, which does not necessarily indicate the
number of new failures on any given date, as some failed positions may persist
for several days. If the net balance of failed shares is below 10,000 for a given
firm, the SEC does not release any information and we record a balance of zero
failures for that day. As shown in Table I, failures to deliver (Qty. Failures) are
relatively rare, with a mean of 0.36% of shares outstanding and a median of
0.00% of shares outstanding.

B. Data Compilation

We match the equity lending database at the firm-month level with infor-
mation from CRSP, Computstat, TAQ, and OptionMetrics. From CRSP, we add
closing stock prices, closing ask and bid prices, shares outstanding, volume,
and monthly returns, including dividend distributions. From TAQ, we add
short sales volume for each stock using the regulation SHO database.? From
OptionMetrics, we add option best bid and offer prices, expiration dates, and
strike prices. As in Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004), we drop contracts
with bid-ask spreads greater than 50%, absolute value of log moneyness greater
than 0.5, or nonpositive-implied volatility. To minimize the impact of illiquidity,
we focus on contracts with greater than 6 days but less than 181 days to
maturity. From Compustat, we add the natural log of the market-to-book ratio.
We define book equity as total shareholder equity minus the book value of pre-
ferred stock plus the book value of deferred taxes and investment tax credits.
If total shareholder equity is missing, we calculate it as the sum of the book
value of common and preferred equity. If all of these are missing, we calculate
shareholder equity as total assets minus total liabilities. Finally, we add NYSE

breakpoints and Fama and French (2015) factors from Kenneth French’s Web
site, and we add the Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) mispricing score from
Robert Stambaugh’s Web site. Panel C of Table I presents summary statistics
for the CRSP data. The mean market capitalization for the firms in our sample
is $3.77 billion and the median market capitalization is $0.46 billion.

C. Measures of Short-Selling Risk

Motivated by the theoretical results discussed in Section I.B, we construct a
measure of short-selling risk (ShortRisk). Specifically, our measure is motivated
by D’Avolio (2002a, p. 279; 2002b), who notes that“... ashort seller is concerned
not only with the level of fees, but also with fee variance.” Accordingly, we first
calculate the natural log of the variance of the daily Loan Fee for each stock
over the past 12 months. We then project this variable on a variety of lagged
firm and lending market characteristics. The predicted value of the model,
which we label ShortRisk, represents a trader’s estimate of short-selling risk
given available information.

In our forecasting regression, we appeal to the prior literature in our choice of
predictive variables. Because Aggarwal, Saffi, and Sturgess (2015) demonstrate
the importance of utilization in the equity loan market, we consider prior loan
utilization as a key forecasting variable. Moreover, because Geczy, Musto, and
Reed (2002) demonstrate the usefulness of prices from new loans, we also
consider the loan fees from new loans. Specifically, we use four equity lending
market characteristics: (i) VarNewFee, (11) VarUtilization, (111) TailNewFee, and
(iv) TailUtilization. VarNewFee is defined as the variance of loan fees for new
equity loans and VarUtilization is defined as the natural log of the variance
of the ratio of equity loan supply to loan demand (i.e., utilization). We also
define two tail risk versions of these variables, TailFee and TailUtilization,
which proxy for the likelihood of extreme loan fees and extreme utilization,
respectively. Specifically, we define TailNewFee and TailUtilization as the 99"
percentile of anormal distribution using the trailing annual mean and variance
of loan fee and utilization, respectively.°

We also consider a number of potentially relevant firm characteristics, in-
cluding several characteristics that are worth noting in this context. Perhaps
most important are lagged values of fee risk, the number of fails to deliver, an
indicator variable for stocks that had an IPO within the last 90 days, and an
indicator variable for stocks with listed options.

and FirmCharacteristics is a vector of time-varying firm characteristics. We
display t-statistics calculated using standard errors clustered by firm and date.
Although our main interest in this section is to find an accurate forecast of
short-selling risk, the results here shed some light on the underlying determi-
nants of short-selling risk. For example, the negative and statistically signifi-
cant coefficient on the option indicator variable suggests that short-selling risk
is lower for stocks with traded options. Similarly, the positive and statistically
significant coefficients on the dividend indicator and the number of fails to
deliver suggest that short-selling risk is higher immediately following an IPO
and for stocks with a large number of failures in the securities lending mar-
ket. Overall, the model can explain 97% of the variation in one-month-ahead
short-selling risk.

Accordingly, we use the predicted value from this model as a forecast of short-
selling risk, which we call ShortRisk.'! Panel D in Table I reports summary
statistics for ShortRisk. The mean value of ShortRisk exceeds the median and
the 99" percentile indicates that there is substantial variation in short-selling
risk in our sample of firms.

III. Results

In this section, we examine whether short-selling risk affects prices and
trading by arbitrageurs. Overall, our findings suggest that higher short-selling
risk is a significant limit to arbitrage.

A. Does Short-Selling Risk Impact Arbitrageurs?

Short sellers face a number of risks. In equilibrium, arbitrageurs should be
compensated for the risks they take (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). In this
section, we begin by showing that high short-selling risk is associated with
lower future returns. We then show that high short-selling risk is associated
with decreased price efficiency and less short selling by arbitrageurs.

A.1. Short-Selling Risk and Future Returns

To start, we form simple portfolios formed by conditioning on our risk mea-
sures. Specifically, each month we form portfolios by sorting firms into quintiles
using the previous month’s short-selling risk. These equal-weighted portfolios
are then held for one calendar month and the exercise is repeated.

Figure 1 shows a strong relation between short-selling risk and future re-
turns. In Panel A, we plot the mean returns to portfolios formed by conditioning
on short-selling risk. Stocks in the low short-selling risk quintile earn monthly
returns of 0.58% per month while stocks in the high short-selling risk quin-
tile earn monthly returns of —0.49% per month. Thus, a long-short portfolio
formed by buying stocks with low short risk and shorting stocks with high short

Figure 1. Portfolio returns from conditioning on short-selling risk. Panel A displays mean
monthly percentage returns for portfolios and Panel B plots the cumulative return to long-short
portfolios calculated over the period July 2006 through December 2011. Each month, portfolios are
formed by sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s short-selling risk and these portfolios
are held for one month. At the far right of Panel A, we display returns from a long-short portfolio
that takes a long position in the low short-selling risk portfolio (quintile 1) and a short position in
the high short-selling risk portfolio (quintile 5). In Panel B, we plot the cumulative returns to a
long-short portfolio that buys stocks in the lowest quintile of short-selling risk and shorts stocks
in the highest quintile of short-selling risk. These equal-weighted portfolios are then held for one
calendar month. (Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)

risk earns 1.08% per month. In Panel B, we plot the cumulative returns to a
long-short strategy over our 2006-2011 sample period. The long-short portfo-
lios consistently earn large returns. Overall, Figure 1 shows a close connection
between short-selling risk and future returns.

Of course, a key concern is whether our results are a form of the well-
established relation between short selling and future returns. Several papers
show that high short interest predicts low future returns at the stock level
(Figlewski (1981), Senchack and Starks (1993), Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang
(2008)), and Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016) show that short interest is
a strong predictor of returns at the market level.

To address this issue, we sort first on short interest and then on our short-
selling risk measures. Panels A and B in Table III report the mean returns to
these portfolios, while Panels A and B in Table IV report five-factor alphas.
In Panel A of Table III, we present the equal-weighted portfolio returns by
quintiles formed on the previous month’s ShortRisk. Conditioning on the level
of short interest in each row, the last column presents mean portfolio returns to
a strategy that goes long firms with ShortRisk in the lowest quintile and short
firms with ShortRisk in the highest quintile. As shown in row 1 (All Firms), the
long-short portfolio (highlighted in the gray box) earns a mean monthly return
of 1.08%, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. In the remaining
rows of Panel A in Table III, we present the returns for each quintile of short
interest. Interestingly, a strategy that buys stocks with low ShortRisk and
shorts stocks with high ShortRisk earns positive and statistically significant
long-short portfolio returns in each of the five short interest quintiles. The
monthly long-short portfolio returns (highlighted in the gray box) range from
0.63% to 1.19% (7.5-14.2% annualized). We stress that while the first row
does not condition on short interest, the remaining rows do. The results are
broadly similar to each other, indicating that the effect is not subsumed by the
previously studied relation between short interest and returns.

Of course, it is possible that our portfolio sorts inadvertently sort on other
common risk factors. Accordingly, Table IV repeats the portfolio exercise with
five-factor alphas (Fama and French (2015)). In all three panels, the results
confirm the findings in Table III. A long-short portfolio formed by conditioning
on our short-selling risk measure earns a five-factor alpha of 0.80% per month
(highlighted in the gray box). We also find that the results generally remain
significant and economically large after conditioning on the level of short in-
terest. In other words, Table IV, as with Table III, is consistent with models of
limits to arbitrage: we find that the returns to short selling are largest when
arbitrage is riskiest.

To better understand how the results hold up throughout the cross section,
we also examine sorts on firm size (market capitalization) to see if the relation
between short-selling risk and returns is concentrated in Micro, Small, or Big
firms. As in Fama and French (2008), we define Micro firms as firms with
market capitalization below the 20‘ percentile of the NYSE breakpoints from
Kenneth French’s Web site, Small firms as firms with market capitalization
greater than or equal to the 20" percentile but less than the 50" percentile of

through December 2011. In Panel A, we examine equal-weighted portfolios formed by first sorting
into quintiles using the previous month’s short interest and then sorting into quintiles using the
previous month’s short-selling risk. In Panel B, we examine value-weighted portfolios formed by
first sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s market capitalization as in Fama and French
(2008) and then sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s short-selling risk. All portfolios
are held for one month. The last column in each panel (Long-Short) shows returns to a long-short
portfolio where firms with short-selling risk in the lowest (highest) quintile are assigned to the
long (short) portfolio. t-statistics are below the estimates italicized and in parentheses. °, ©’, and

Monthly Five-Factor Alphas from Conditioning on Short-Selling Risk

This table presents monthly Fama and French (2015) five-factor alphas (in percent) calculated over
the period July 2006 through December 2011. In Panel A, we examine equal-weighted portfolios
formed by first sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s short interest and then sorting
into quintiles using the previous month’s short-selling risk. In Panel B, we examine value-weighted
portfolios formed by first sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s market capitalization
as in Fama and French (2008) and then sorting into quintiles using the previous month’s short-
selling risk. All portfolios are held for one month. The last column in each panel (Long-Short) shows
returns to a long-short portfolio where firms with short-selling risk in the lowest (highest) quintile
are assigned to the long (short) portfolio. The reported alphas are the intercept from regressing
portfolio returns in excess of the one-month risk-free rate, on the excess market return (MKT), size
(SMB), book-to-market (HML), profitability (RMW), and investment (CMA) factors. t-statistics are

sults exhibit weaker statistical significance). In Table III, we find positive and

statistically significant long-short returns for both Micro and Small stocks,
ranging from 0.65% to 1.04%. Similarly, in Table IV we find positive and statis-
tically significant five-factor alphas for Micro and Small stocks, ranging from
0.38% to 0.88%. In a sense, the fact that our results are strongest among Micro
and Small stocks is not surprising as there is relatively little short-selling risk
in the sample of Large stocks. The 99*" percentile of loan fees in the Micro
sample is 1,119 bps; the 99*" percentile of loan fees in the Large stock sample is
only 236 bps. Similarly, the 90 percentile is 189 bps for Micro stocks and only
20 bps for the Large stocks. In addition, we note that while Micro and Small
stocks represent a relatively small portion of total market capitalization, they
are a large portion of the market by number. In our analyses, these stocks rep-
resent approximately 75% of the sample. Thus, while our results are weaker
among Large stocks, they do occur throughout a large portion of U.S. equities.

Interestingly, we also note that our sort results suggest that low short-selling
risk stocks are also priced differently. While the high short-selling risk port-
folios consistently earn negative returns, many of the Jow short-selling risk
portfolios earn high returns, a result consistent with Boehmer, Huszar, and
Jordan (2010). Nonetheless, taken together, our sort results indicate that arbi-
trageurs are being compensated for the risk they take on their short positions.

Finally, we adopt the regression approach of Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang
(2008) to control for more firm characteristics.!? In particular, we run monthly
Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions of the form

Retji41 = a+ ByShort Risk; + BoShort Interest; + Controls + €441, (2)

where 7 indexes firms, t indexes time, the dependent variable is the buy-and-
hold return over the subsequent month in excess of the one-month risk-free
rate, Short Interest; is the quantity of shares borrowed as of the last day of the
month normalized by each firm’s shares outstanding, and Controls is a vector
of control variables: Market/ Book is the log of the market-to-book ratio from
Compustat, Market Cap is the log of market capitalization, Idio. Volatility is
the log of the monthly standard deviation of the daily residual from a Fama
and French (1993) three-factor regression,!* Bid-Ask is the log of the closing
bid-ask spread calculated as a fraction of the closing midpoint, and Return; _ 1
is the return on each stock lagged by one month.

Our contribution is to introduce a measure of an arbitrageur’s short-selling
risk. The results are reported in Table V. In all models, the coefficient on Short
Interest is consistent with Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008): we find that short

18 While we follow a similar approach to that in Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008), our specifi-
cation includes several differences. First, we use a different sample period from Boehmer, Jones,
and Zhang (2008), and we examine a different set of firms (we examine the entire CRSP universe
of equities while they focus on NYSE firms). Second, we use a measure of Short Interest as an
independent variable, while they use Short Volume.

14 We calculate idiosyncratic volatility as the standard deviation, each month, of the daily resid-
ual from a Fama and French (1998) three-factor model estimated using daily return data over our
entire sample period.

Table V

Cross-Sectional Relation between Monthly Percentage Returns and
Short-Selling Risk

The table presents Fama and MacBeth (1973) regression results. For each model, we run 63
monthly cross-sectional regressions of the form

Ret; 441 =a + ByShortRisk; 4 + BgShortInterest; 4 + Controls + &).441,

where Ret is the buy-and-hold return over the subsequent month, in excess of the one-month
risk-free rate. ShortRisk is the fitted value from a regression model that forecasts future loan fee
variance. Short Interest; — 9 is the quantity of shares borrowed, normalized by shares outstanding.
The controls include Mispricing, the mispricing measure from Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015),
Market / Book, the log of the market-to-book ratio, Market Cap, the log of market capitalization
lagged by one month, Idio. Volatility, the log of idiosyncratic volatility from a Fama and French
(1993) three-factor regression, Bid-Ask, the log of the closing bid-ask spread, Return; _ 1, the return
on each stock lagged by one month, Loan Fee, the cost of borrowing a share in bps per annum,
and Loan Supply, the total number of shares that are actively available to be lent (as a fraction of
shares outstanding). We report the time-series mean of the parameter estimates with t-statistics,

sales activity, as measured by Short Interest, is negative. In other words, high
levels of short selling are associated with future price decreases.

In all models, the negative and statistically significant coefficient on Short-
Risk is consistent with the hypothesis that short-selling risk is a significant
limit to arbitrage.!° In particular, we find in model (1) that a one-standard-
deviation increase in ShortRisk is associated with a 40 bp decrease in future
monthly returns (a decrease of approximately 4.7% per year). In other words,
on average, the returns to short selling are larger in the presence of greater
short-selling risk.

In model (3), we consider how short-selling risk, as a limit to arbitrage,
interacts with mispricing as measured by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015).
We refer to the mispricing variable as MISP, and it is based on 11 anomalies
from the existing literature.'® High (low) values of the MISP variable are the
most overpriced (underpriced) according to Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015).
When we interact ShortRisk and MISP, we find a negative and statistically
significant coefficient, which suggests that stocks that are both overpriced and
risky to short have especially low returns going forward.!’ In other words,
consistent with models of limits to arbitrage, we find that higher short-selling
risk appears to limit the ability of arbitrageurs to correct mispricing, and, as a
result, these stocks earn lower future returns. As ShortRisk and MISP increase,
we find that future returns get lower. When both ShortRisk and MISP are at
their 90" percentiles, the next month’s return is 22 bps lower than when both
ShortRisk and MISP are at their 50° percentiles.

Overall, the findings in Tables III through V suggest that higher short-selling
risk limits the ability of arbitrageurs to correct mispricing; as a result, stocks
with high short-selling risk earn predictably lower future returns. We note that
we control for the current loan fee in models (2) and (3) of Table V, since it is
well known that high-equity loan fees predict low future stock returns (e.g.,
Jones and Lamont (2002), Drechsler and Drechsler (2014), Beneish, Lee, and
Nichols (2015)). Thus, our results show that the risk of future short-selling
risk constraints affects returns even after controlling for current short sale
constraints and other known predictors of returns.

The evidence above also sheds light on an unresolved puzzle. Several papers
have shown that high short interest predicts low future returns (Figlewski
(1981), Senchack and Starks (1993), Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter (2005),
Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008), Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016)).
It is an open question as to why publicly available short interest data continue

15 Because ShortRisk is a generated regressor (Pagan (1984)), we calculate the standard errors
of the coefficients using a block bootstrap with 200 replications. The bootstrap does not significantly
alter the standard errors. The results are qualitatively unchanged if we instead use Newey and
West (1987) standard errors with three lags, where we set the lag length = T” = 66” = 3 as
discussed in Greene (2002).

16 Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) do not use any short selling-based anomalies in their mis-
pricing measure.

17 When there is no interaction term, the coefficient estimate on MISP is negative and significant
as in Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015).

to have return predictability. Our results show that this puzzle is particularly
strong among stocks with high short-selling risk. Although existing literature
has been unable to fully explain the puzzle with static short-selling risk con-
straints (e.g., Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2009)), our paper suggests that
dynamic constraints (i.e., short-selling risk) may help explain more of the puz-
zle. In other words, short sellers continue to earn abnormal returns in part
because short selling is risky.

A.2. Short-Selling Risk and Price Efficiency

Of course, if short-selling risk is a limit to arbitrage it may also decrease
price efficiency. In this section, we use our proxies for short-selling risk to
test whether more short-selling risk is associated with less price efficiency.
We first estimate the Hou and Moskowitz (2005) measures of price efficiency
by regressing the weekly returns of stock i on the current value-weighted
market return and four lags of the value-weighted market return. Intuitively,
the coefficients on lagged market returns are a measure of price delay—if the
return on stock i instantaneously reflects all available information, then the
lagged returns should have little explanatory power. Specifically, for each stock
i and year y, we estimate the regression

reti, =a + By Tme + > 67° Tmt—j | + €i.t, (3)
j=l

where ret; is the return on stock 7 in week ¢ and ret,,; is the value-weighted
market return from CRSP in week t. We then calculate two measures of price
delay, labeled D1 and D2, as follows:

where the denominator is the unconstrained R? and the numerator is the R?
from a regression in which the coefficients on all lagged market returns are
constrained to equal zero, and

where £ and 6 are the regression coefficients shown in equation (3). We then
test to see if our proxies for short-selling risk are associated with increased
price delay (i.e., worse price efficiency). To do so, we estimate the following
ordinary least squares (OLS) panel regression, similar to Saffi and Sigurdsson
(2011):

Table VI
Price Efficiency and Short-Selling Risk

This table examines the relation between the Hou and Moskowitz (2005) measure of price efficiency
and short-selling risk using OLS panel models of the form

PriceDelay; , = « + Bi ShortRisk + 2 LoanFee + 63 LoanSupply + Conrols + €(.y,

where the dependent variable, PriceDelay, is the D1 price delay measure from Hou and Moskowitz
(2005). ShortRisk is the fitted value from a regression model that forecasts future loan fee variance.
Loan Fee is the mean cost of borrowing a share in bps per annum, divided by 100 for scale purposes.
Loan Supply is the mean total number of shares owned by institutions that are actively available to
be lent (as a fraction of shares outstanding). The controls include Qty. Failures, the total quantity
of shares that were not delivered as scheduled; Market Cap., the log of mean market capitalization
for each firm-year; Volume, the log of mean total trading volume for each firm (as a fraction of
shares outstanding); Bid-Ask Spread, the mean bid-ask spread; and Listed Option, an indicator
for whether a stock has listed options. All variables are annual and we include year fixed effects in
all models. t-statistics, calculated using a block bootstrap with 200 replications, are shown below
the coefficient estimates italicized and in parentheses. ", *’, and denote statistical significance

The results are reported in Table VI with t-statistics, calculated using a block
bootstrap with 200 replications, presented below the coefficient estimates. We
include year fixed effects in all models to control for possible unobserved het-
erogeneity. Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011) examine the relation between price
efficiency and contemporaneous short sale constraints and find that firms with
high loan supply tend to have significantly better price efficiency. The statis-
tically significant negative coefficient on Loan Supply confirms the findings of

Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011). However, we also find that uncertainty regarding
future short sale constraints is associated with decreased price efficiency. In
all models, the positive and statistically significant coefficient on ShortRisk
indicates that higher uncertainty about future loan fees is associated with a
significantly larger price delay for the measure calculated in equation (4). In
model (2), a one-standard-deviation increase in ShortRisk is associated with
a 6.8% increase in price delay relative to its unconditional mean.!® In other
words, the risk of future short-selling constraints is associated with decreased
price efficiency today, independent of short constraints that may exist at the
time a short position is initiated.

Taking the results in Table VI together, a general pattern emerges: higher
short-selling risk is associated with decreased price efficiency.

A.3. Short-Selling Risk and Expected Holding Horizon

If short-selling risk is truly a limit to arbitrage, we would expect this risk
to affect trading activity (D’Avolio (2002a)), especially for trades with a long
expected time to completion. As Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004) note,
the risk of short selling increases with the holding period. For example, an
arbitrageur shorting a stock with a volatile rebate rate is much more concerned
about the volatility if his expected holding horizon is long. As a result, the
arbitrageur is less likely to put on the trade in the first place.

To test this prediction, we examine a unique environment in which both the
magnitude of the mispricing and the expected holding horizon of a trade can be
measured ex ante. Specifically, we examine a measure of mispricing from Ofek,
Richardson, and Whitelaw (2004), PutCallDisparity, which is defined as the log
difference between the stock price from the spot market and the synthetic stock
price implied from put-call parity in the options market. Ofek, Richardson, and
Whitelaw (2004) and Evans et al. (2009) show that when PutCallDisparity
is positive, a short seller would want to short sell the underlying stock and
purchase the synthetic stock, and she would expect the two to converge by the
option expiration date.

Accordingly, Table VII examines the relation between PutCallDisparity,
short-selling risk, and holding horizon using OLS panel regressions of the
form

PutCallDisparity; , = B\Months to Expiration; ,+ BgShort Risk; ;-1
+ Bs(Short Riskiz;-1 x Months to Expiration, ,)
+ Controls + FE; + FE; + €;.2, (7)

where i indexes firms, t indexes time, and Months to Expiration is our mea-
sure of the arbitrageur’s expected holding horizon, defined as the number of
months between an option’s expiration date and the current date. The variable

18 The variable ShortRisk has a standard deviation of 3.00 and the Hou and Moskowitz (2005)
price delay measure has an unconditional mean of 0.32. Therefore, 6.8% = (0.0072 * 3.00)/0.32.

ShortRisk is calculated as before but is now matched to the option expiration
date. Specifically, we first run predictive regressions as in equation (1), where
the dependent variable is loan fee variance measured over 1-30 days, 31-60
days, 61-90 days, and so on. We then take this forecast, ShortRisk, and use it
as a predictor of PutCallDisparity measured using the same option expiration
window. This lets us match the holding horizon of the arbitrageur with the
expected short-selling risk she will face over that horizon.

We include firm and date fixed effects in all models to control for possi-
ble unobserved heterogeneity. The coefficient estimates are shown in Table
VII with t-statistics (shown in parentheses below the coefficient estimates)
calculated using a block bootstrap with 200 replications. To examine the gen-
eral relation between short-selling risk and mispricing, in model (1) we omit
the interaction between ShortRisk and Months to Expiration. In this specifi-
cation, the positive and statistically significant coefficient on short risk sug-
gests that the no-arbitrage put-call parity equation is more likely to be vi-
olated when short-selling risk is high. In other words, the results provide
additional support for our main hypothesis: short-selling risk leads to more
mispricing.

In models (2) and (3), we add an interaction term between ShortRisk and
Months to Expiration to test whether short-selling risk matters more for trades
with a longer expected holding period. We find evidence that it does. In model
(3), the statistically significant coefficient of 0.0303 on the interaction term
suggests that PutCallDisparity is 13.9% above its unconditional mean when
both ShortRisk and Months to Expiration are at the 25‘. percentile in our
sample, but the effect increases to 149% when both ShortRisk and Months to
Expiration are at the 75" percentile of our sample.!’ In other words, there
is significantly more mispricing today when short-selling risk is high and the
trade has a long expected holding horizon. Similarly, in model (2) we find that
the impact of ShortRisk increases for options with a longer time to expiration.

Importantly, in models (1) and (2) we control for the current level of short
sale constraints by including Loan Fee as a control variable. Ofek, Richardson,
and Whitelaw (2004) and Evans et al. (2009) find that the magnitude of Put-
CallDisparity is related to the level of short sale constraints today. Our results
go beyond this finding—we show that, even after controlling for the level of cur-
rent short-selling constraints, the risk of short-selling constraints is associated
with a more mispricing today.

In models (1) through (3) of Table VII, we find that short-selling risk is
associated with more mispricing today. Existing theoretical work (e.g., D’Avolio
and Perold (2003)) posits that higher mispricing today is a result of less trading
by arbitrageurs. Accordingly, we next examine the relation between daily short

19 The unconditional mean of PutCallDisparity is 0.46. When ShortRisk is at the 25*° percentile
of its distribution (1.54) and Months to Expiration is at the 25*° percentile of its distribution
(two months), we find that PutCall Disparity is 13.9% higher = (0.0122 x 2 + —0.0348 x 1.54 +
0.0303 x 2 x 1.54)/0.46. However, when ShortRisk is at the 75“ percentile of its distribution (5.38)
and Months to Expiration is at the 75‘. percentile of its distribution (five months), we find that
PutCallDisparity is 149% higher = (0.0122 x 5 + —0.0348 x 5.38 + 0.0303 x 5 x 5.38)/0.46.

sale volume, short-selling risk, and expected holding horizon using OLS panel
regressions of the form

Short Volume; ; = B1PutCallDisparity; , + B2Months to Expiration; ,
+ B3Short Risk; .-1 + Ba(Short Risk; 4-1
x Months to Expiration; ,) + Controls+FE;+FE;+¢;, (8)

where i indexes firms, ¢ indexes time, and short volume is the number of shares
shorted each day from TAQ, expressed as a fraction of shares outstanding. The
results are reported in models (4) through (6) of Table VII; we include firm and
date fixed effects in all models with standard errors calculated using a block
bootstrap with 200 replications. As in models (1) through (3), we again calculate
Short Risk as predicted loan fee variance measured over 1—30 days, 31-60 days,
61-90 days, and so on, matching the holding horizon of PutCallDisparity and
Months to Expiration. This lets us match the holding horizon of the arbitrageur
with the expected short-selling risk she will face over that horizon.

Consistent with theory (e.g., D’Avolio and Perold (2003)), we find that short
volume is decreasing in both the holding horizon and short-selling risk. In
model (4), the negative and statistically significant coefficient of —0.0763 on
ShortRisk implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in short-selling risk
is associated with a 10.6% decrease in short volume, relative to its uncondi-
tional mean. In other words, short sellers trade less today when short risk is
high over the expected holding horizon of their trade.

Following the logic that motivated the analysis in equation (7), we expect
short risk to matter more for trades with a longer expected holding horizon.
Thus, in models (5) and (6) we again examine the interaction between Short-
Risk and Months to Expiration. In all models, the negative coefficient on the
interaction term shows that the effect of short risk is strongest when Months to
Expiration is larger, in other words, we find that short sellers trade less when
the expected holding period is long. In model (6), the results suggest that short
volume is 5.1% lower when both ShortRisk and Months to Expiration are at
the 25‘ percentile in our sample, but the effect increases to 21.7% when both
ShortRisk and Months to Expiration are at the 75“ percentile of our sample.”°
In other words, short sellers trade significantly less when short-selling risk is
high and this effect is compounded by long holding horizons.

The result in Table VII also relates to a long-standing question in the existing
short-selling literature. Several papers find it puzzling that investors do not
short sell stocks in larger amounts (e.g., Lamont and Stein (2004), Duarte,
Lou, and Sadka (2006)). Our results suggest that short sellers trade less when

20 The unconditional mean of short volume/shares outstanding is 2.26. When ShortRisk is at
the 25* percentile of its distribution (1.54) and Months to Expiration is at the 25“ percentile of its
distribution (two months), we find that short volume is 5.1% lower = (—0.0004 x 2 + —0.0731 x 1.54
+ —0.0001 x 2 x 1.54)/2.26. However, when ShortRisk is at the 75° percentile of its distribution
(5.38) and Months to Expiration is at the 75* percentile of its distribution (five months), we find
that short volume is 21.7% lower = (—0.0004 x 5 + —0.0731 x 5.388 + —0.0001~x 5 x 5.38)/2.26.

short-selling risk is high, especially for trades with a long expected holding
horizon. In other words, short-selling risk may help explain why there is so
little short selling.

B. Noise Trader Risk and Short-Selling Risk

In the preceding subsections, we document and examine several unique risks
faced by short sellers and find that higher short-selling risk is associated with
lower future returns, less price efficiency, and less trading by arbitrageurs. In
this section, we explore the relation between short-selling risk and other limits
to arbitrage. For example, Lamont (2012) notes that lending market conditions
appear to deteriorate precisely when short sellers most want to trade, and
he notes that some firms actively try to impact lending market conditions to
prevent short sellers from trading. As a result, short-selling risk may be related
to other market conditions, and these covariances may exacerbate existing
limits to arbitrage.

As a first pass, in Figures 2 and 3 we conduct a simple analysis in which
we sort stocks by their past 20-day return ranking and compare their return
ranking to changes in share availability and changes in loan fees. The results
are striking: in Panel A of Figure 2, there is a strong U-shaped pattern in loan
fees (highlighted by gray vertical bars), indicating that loan fees tend to be high
for stocks with extreme returns. Specifically, in our sample of U.S. equities over
the period July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2011, the unconditional mean
loan fee is 85 bps per annum. However, for the 2% of stocks that experienced
the largest price increase over the previous 20 days, the mean loan fee is almost
three times larger with a mean value of 236 bps per annum, a movement that
corresponds to nearly 40% of a standard deviation. In Panel B, we examine
loan fee changes and again find that loans fees tend to increase for stocks with
extreme stock returns.

In fact, we find that loan fees increase significantly when past returns are
in either the highest or the lowest quartile of returns. Moreover, in Figure 3
we find a strong hump-shaped pattern in loan supply, indicating that the sup-
ply of shares available to be borrowed exhibits a similar pattern. While the
unconditional mean loan supply is 18% of shares outstanding, the mean loan
supply is only 12% for the 2% of stocks that experienced the largest price in-
crease over the previous 20 days, a movement that corresponds to over 40%
of a standard deviation. In other words, when a short seller’s position moves
against her, it is likely that it will be more difficult to borrow shares in the
equity lending market.

In Table VIII, we run an OLS panel regression specification designed to test
the patterns shown in Figures 2 and 3. In particular, we run regressions of the
form

where the dependent variable, LendingMarketCondition;,, is either Loan Fee; ;
or Loan Supply;;. The results confirm that when returns are in either the
lowest or the highest decile of past returns, loan fees are higher and loan
supply is lower. Specifically, in model (2) we find that firms in the bottom decile
of past returns tend to have loan fees that are 13 bps higher and firms that
are in the top decile of past returns tend to have loan fees that are 10 bps
higher. Compared to the unconditional mean (median) loan fee of 85 bps (11
bps), these results are economically large, with the latter result suggesting that
loan fees increase precisely when a short seller’s position has moved against
her. Similarly, in model (4) we find that firms in the top decile of past returns
tend to have significantly lower loan supply. In fact, the statistically significant
coefficient estimate of —0.7117 on HighPastReturns; in model (4) suggests that
loan supply levels fall when past returns are high, precisely when it is most
costly for a short seller.

One potential concern with these results is that we have omitted a firm
characteristic in the specification that jointly determines extreme returns and
high loan fees. For example, small stocks or illiquid stocks might have high
loan fees and also extreme returns. To address this concern, models (2) and
(4) include firm fixed effects so that the coefficients are estimated within-firm.
Although the magnitude of the coefficient shrinks, the conclusion remains the
same: loan fees rise when a stock’s return is extremely high or extremely low,

and loan supply contracts precisely when a stock’s return is extremely high.
In other words, short-selling risk is not only a limit to arbitrage on its own—it
may also magnify other previously studied limits to arbitrage.

IV. Conclusion

Most of the short-selling literature takes a static view of short-selling costs:
if loan fees are high or shares unavailable today, prices may be too high today.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic, risk-based view. Among a cross-section
of approximately 4,500 U.S. stocks traded from July 2006 through December
2011, we find that long-short portfolios based on short-selling risk have five-
factor alphas of 75 bps per month. Furthermore, we find that short-selling
risk is associated with decreased price efficiency and less short selling today.
Overall, we find that short-selling risk is associated with more mispricing and
less short selling, especially for trades with longer holding periods.

This evidence sheds light on two puzzles in the short-selling literature.
Specifically, several papers have shown that high short interest predicts low
future returns, which begs the question of why publicly available short interest
data continue to have return predictability. Our results show that this puzzle is
particularly strong among stocks with high short-selling risk, which suggests
that dynamic short sale constraints may explain some of the puzzle. Moreover,
the literature finds it surprising that investors do not short sell stocks in larger
amounts. We find that short sellers trade less when short-selling risk is high,
which suggests that dynamic short sale constraints help explain the low level of
short selling. Taking the two puzzles together, the overall idea emerges: when
short selling is risky, short sellers are less likely to trade and prices are too
high.
